üè® Hotel Booking Analysis

Welcome to the Hotel Booking Analysis project! This repository contains the data analysis and findings on hotel reservation patterns, with a focus on understanding the factors that lead to cancellations. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help hotels optimize their pricing strategies, reduce cancellation rates, and enhance their overall booking experience.
üìä Research Questions

    What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
    How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
    How can hotels make more informed pricing and promotional decisions?

üí° Hypotheses

    Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
    Longer waiting lists result in higher cancellation rates.
    The majority of bookings are made through offline travel agents.

üîç Analysis and Findings

Our analysis has led to several key findings:

    Cancellation Rates:
        A significant 37% of reservations were canceled, impacting the hotel's earnings.

    Booking Trends:
        City Hotels vs. Resort Hotels: City hotels received more bookings, likely due to lower average daily rates compared to resort hotels.
        Seasonal Patterns: The month of August saw the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, while January experienced the most cancellations.

    Price Sensitivity:
        Higher Rates, Higher Cancellations: A direct correlation was observed between the average daily rate and cancellation rates, with higher prices leading to more cancellations.

    Geographical Insights:
        Portugal Tops Cancellations: Among all countries, Portugal had the highest number of canceled reservations.
        Booking Channels: Approximately 46% of clients booked through online travel agencies, followed by 27% from groups, with only 4% making direct bookings.

üìà Visual Insights

We've included several graphs in the analysis to illustrate the trends and correlations:

    Bar Graph: Shows the percentage of reservations that were canceled versus those that were not.
    Line Graph: Compares the average daily rates between city hotels and resort hotels over different days.
    Grouped Bar Graph: Analyzes the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels.

üí° Suggestions for Hotels

To mitigate cancellations and improve booking outcomes, we recommend the following strategies:

    Price Adjustments: Implement dynamic pricing strategies to offer more competitive rates, particularly in high-cancellation periods.
    Discounts and Promotions: Offer discounts during weekends and holidays, especially for resort hotels, to encourage bookings.
    Seasonal Campaigns: Launch targeted marketing campaigns in January, when cancellations peak, to boost occupancy rates.
    Quality Improvements: Focus on enhancing service quality in regions like Portugal, where cancellation rates are high.
